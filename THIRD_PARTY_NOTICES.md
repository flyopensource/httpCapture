## Proxify

The httpCapture CLI embeds the proxy implementation from
[ProjectDiscovery Proxify](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/proxify), based
on upstream version `v0.0.16` at commit
`cb351162a2389e4e25c702fc60c98e8e6fa988fa`. httpCapture bypasses the upstream
asynchronous traffic logger and uses bounded streaming capture callbacks so
that response bodies, status codes, timing, and JSONL session boundaries are
reliable without buffering unbounded bodies in memory.
